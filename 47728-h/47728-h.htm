<p class="drop-cap">ALL animals with lungs have some
sort of contrivance in the windpipe
that is able to set the air
in vibration as it is expelled or
inhaled. Some have not only this
means of making vocal sound, but
have also power to vary the quality
and intensity of it. Out of this second
ability come speech and song.</p>

<p>Ants converse with their antennæ,
having no lungs nor windpipe. Bees
do the same. Those of her attendants
who first perceive the absence of the
queen from the hive apply their antennæ
to the feelers of their companions.
The ensuing excitement settles
the question as to their ability to talk.
This shows that while voice is the usual
organ of language there is yet a good
deal of conversation going on about us
that is not expressed in words, just as
there is much music performed by insect
orchestras with no vocal contributions.</p>

<p>Hares and Rabbits never use their
voices except when suffering intensely.
When caught by an enemy or wounded
in the chase they utter the only cry
that ever escapes from their throats.
Spasmodic agitation of the chest
muscles and the larynx gives forth the
sound. Such unintentional utterances
are frequent in other animals that use
their voices freely when nothing has
injured them, as the death shrieks of
cattle and the screams of horses attacked
by wolves.</p>

<p>It is of little use to ask why animals
are equipped with voices, for the fact is
an animal could hardly be constructed
with lungs and apparatus for controlling
ingress and egress of air without the
controlling organ's being more or less
noisy or even musical. Snorts, snores,
whistles, purrs, groans, and trumpetings
follow naturally where the bellows
and pipe are active.</p>

<p>Although Darwin considers that the
habit of uttering musical sounds was
first acquired for courtship, and that in
man it was early associated only with
his strongest emotions, such as love,
rivalry, and triumph, the writer holds
the opinion that both significant and
musical utterance originated not in
any desire to move others, but was
cultivated solely for the pleasure it
gave the one who made it.</p>

<p>If primitive man did not receive
language ready-made at creation, but
developed it as the philologists claim,
it was a gradual acquisition. While
our early ancestor dug in the ground
he emitted certain sounds, as he pursued
he uttered others, and as he devoured
he indulged in a different grunt
or exclamation. When he wished to
call the attention of others to one of
these acts he merely reproduced the
sound that went naturally with it. And
so <i>clamor concomitans</i> became <i>clamor
significans</i>. But the sound as it came
forth at first had no meaning and no
design. The man made the sound
rather instinctively than mentally and
he enjoyed making sounds as much as
a baby now enjoys crowing or a youngster
delights in yelling when he has no
ideas he cares to convey. Much of
the singing of birds is done merely because
the birds wish to please themselves
with the sounds peculiar to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
themselves. They are, as a rule, in no-wise
trying to charm their mates, and
they are not at all desirous of pleasing
anyone but themselves. It would be
as reasonable to claim that the carpenter
on the roof is whistling to please
his sweetheart or that the lumberman
alone with his cattle in the forest trolls
forth his jolly song for any amorous
reason. There are times when these
purposes are the cause of singing, but
the fact is that the great majority of
the singing and whistling done by
men, birds, and beasts sounds far better
to the ones that produce it than to
any other. In fact, society itself would
be in a far better state if the men and
women who sing would only acknowledge
that they are doing so mainly to
please themselves, and they might
then be persuaded in part to leave off
trying to surprise their hearers at
times by singing louder or higher or
faster than nature intended they should
do. Most people enjoy listening to
song, but no one can appreciate the
beauties of it so well as the artistic
singer who has acquired his talents by
assiduous and intelligent discipline.
His enjoyment of his own efforts is as
much higher than that of his auditors
as is the pleasure of the man who sings
out of tune above the felicity of his
hearers.</p>

<p>Elephants speak in three ways.
Pleasure is evinced by blowing the
proboscis in a sharp manner&mdash;like the
sound of a trumpeter learning. Wants
are murmured over in the mouth.
Rage roars tremendously low in the
throat. While these sounds are not
made for the purpose of informing
others of states of feeling, yet they
do convey to man and beast an idea of
what is going on. So the lower animals
accidentally, if you please, have a
sort of language. It is instinctive and
conveys no intelligence not immediately
connected with the present state
of the speaker or his community.</p>

<p>Marcgrave says he has frequently
seen the meetings held by the Ouarine
Monkeys and enjoyed their deliberations.
"Every day they assemble in
the woods to receive instructions. One
takes the highest place on the tree
and makes a signal with his hand for
the rest to sit round. As soon as he
sees them placed he begins his discourse
in a loud and precipitate voice;
the rest preserve a profound silence.
When he has done he makes a sign
with his hand for the rest to reply. At
that instant they raise their voices
together, until by another signal silence
is enjoined."</p>

<p>Professor Garner has studied simian
speech so carefully that he is able to
converse with Monkeys to a limited
extent. He says they have words for
"food" and "drink," have a spoken salutation,
and can distinguish numbers
up to about three, and have some
notion of music. "In brief, they appear
to have at least the raw material
out of which are made the most exalted
attributes of man."</p>

<p>Aristotle noticed that voices vary
with conditions when he gravely announced
that the Calf affords the only
instance in nature where the voice of
the young is deeper and graver than
that of its parent. Wild animals frequently
change their voices on domestication.
Domestic Dogs and even tame
Jackals have learned to bark, which is
a noise not proper to any species of
the genus, with the possible exception
of the <i>Canis latrans</i> of North America.
Columbus discovered that Dogs left
by him on an island where there was no
game nor any other occasion for barking
lost their voices completely before
he visited them on a subsequent voyage.
Some breeds of domestic Pigeons
coo in a new and quite peculiar manner
not manifested in their wild state.</p>

<p>The same species of birds living in
different localities sometimes have
different vocal habits. An excellent
observer says an Irish covey of Partridges
spring without uttering a call,
while, on the opposite coast, the Scotch
covey accompany their springing with
intense shrieks. Bechstein says that
from many years of experience he is
certain that in the Nightingale a tendency
to sing in the middle of the
night or in the day runs in families
and is strictly inherited.</p>

<p>As the Parrot acquires human language
by association with unfeathered
bipeds, so do many voices modify
themselves as circumstances alter, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the particular sound which one day
may accompany and express fright
or anger may be laid aside for another
more suitable to new conditions, much
as a man uses different sounds in asking
for butter at a French restaurant
and in a German inn. And while it is
probably not true that speech was
given for the purposes of communicating
with others, it has occurred in nature
that speech has become the principal
means of transmitting ideas.</p>

<p>An old Goose had her nest in the
kitchen of a farmer. She had been
endeavoring for a fortnight to hatch
some eggs, but was taken ill rather
suddenly and found she could not finish
the task. With evident agony she
repaired to an outhouse where was a
Goose of but one year's growth. In
some way she told the young sister
that her valuable mission was about to
be interrupted ere its fulfillment and
implored her to become her successor.
So complete was the communication
between them that the young one entered
the kitchen and took her place,
with evident maternal pride, remaining
there till the eggs were hatched and
afterwards caring assiduously for the
welfare of the Goslings. The old
Goose expired contentedly before incubation
was complete.</p>

<p>A gentleman who visited London occasionally
was usually accompanied by
a small Dog. Nearing the city, he put
up at an inn and left the Terrier there to
await his return. Once, as he came
back from London, the Dog was not
there. He had had a fight with a large
Housedog and been so badly wounded
that it was thought he would not recover.
But after lying quietly for a
couple of days he disappeared. About
a week later he returned with a larger
animal, sought his adversary, and by
union of efforts gave him a terrible
punishment. It was found that his
coadjutor was a neighbor, and that the
wounded animal must have traveled
long to visit his friend, had been able
to tell him of his sorrows, awaken his
sympathies, and keep him enlisted in
his cause all the while they were on
their way to seek their enemy, and was
no doubt able to congratulate his partner
many times during the homeward
journey on the success of their valorous
enterprise.</p>

<p>Professor Morgan says: "I find that
the sounds emitted by young Chicks
are decidedly instinctive&mdash;that is to
say, they are inherited modes of giving
expression to certain emotional states.
And some of them are fairly differentiated.
At least six may be distinguished:
First, the gentle, piping sound
expressive of contentment&mdash;for example,
when one takes the little bird in
one's hand. A further low note, a sort
of double sound, seems to be associated
with extreme pleasure, as when one
strokes the Chick's back. Very characteristic
and distinct is the danger
note. This is heard on the second or
third day. If a large Humble-bee, or
a black Beetle, or a big lump of sugar,
or in fact anything largish and strange,
be thrown to them this danger note is
at once heard. Then there is the piping
sound, expressive apparently of
wanting something. It generally ceases
when one goes near them and throws
some grain, or even only stands near
them. My Chicks were accustomed to
my presence in the room, and generally
were restless, and continuously
made this sound when I left them.
Then there is the sharp squeak when
one seizes a Chick against its inclination.
Lastly there is the shrill cry of
distress, when, for example, one of
them is separated from the rest. I
have very little doubt that all of these
sounds have a suggestive value of emotional
import for the other Chicks.
Certainly the danger-note at once
places others on the alert, and the
pleasure-note will cause others to come
to the spot where the little bird is when
the note is sounded."</p>

<p>A good story is told by H. B. Medlicott
to show what ideas wild pigs can
express in sounds. "In the early dawn
of a gray morning I was geologizing
along the base of the Muhair hills in
South Behar, when all of a sudden
there was a stampede of many Pigs
from the fringe of a jungle, with porcine
shrieks of <i>sauve-qui-peut</i> significance.
After a short run in the open
they took to the jungle again, and in a
few minutes there was another uproar,
but different in sound and in action;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
there was a rush, presumably of the
fighting members, to the spot where
the row began, and after some seconds
a large Leopard sprang from the midst
of the scuffle. In a few bounds he was
in the open, and stood looking back,
licking his chaps. The Pigs did not
break cover, but continued on their way.
They were returning to their lair after
a night's feeding in the plain, several
families having combined for mutual
protection; while the beasts of prey
were evidently waiting for the occasion.
I was alone, and though armed, I did
not care to beat up the ground to see
if in either case a kill had been effected.
The numerous herd covered a considerable
space, and the scrub was thick.
The prompt concerted action must in
each case have been started by a special
cry. I imagine that the first assailant
was a Tiger, and the case was at
once known to be hopeless, the cry
prompting instant flight, while in the
second case the cry was for defense. It
can scarcely be doubted that in the first
case each adult Pig had a vision of a
Tiger, and the second of a Leopard or
some minor foe."</p>

<p>The structure of throats that talk and
sing varies greatly, and scientists have
yet much to learn about the adaptations
of forms to purposes. Agassiz gives
the following clear description of the
throats of birds: "The proper larynx
is very simple, destitute of vocal chords,
and incapable of producing sounds; but
at the lower end of the windpipe there
is a second or inferior larynx, which is
very complicated in structure. It is a
kind of bony drum, having within it
two glottises, formed at the top of the
two branches of the windpipe, each provided
with two vocal chords. The different
pieces of this apparatus are
moved by peculiar muscles, the number
of which varies in different families.
In birds which have a very monotonous
cry, such as the Gulls, the Herons,
the Cuckoos, and the Mergansers,
there is but one or two pairs; Parrots
have three; and birds of song have five."
But there are still further items regarding
special uses that make the question
hard to solve.</p>

<p>Some throats that have apparently
the same structure as far as the scalpel
and microscope can distinguish have
marvelously different powers of delivery.
MacGillivray has pointed out that
the Rook and the Hooded Crow seem
to have just as complex an apparatus
for their sepulchral utterances as the
Nightingale and the Blackbird. But
where loudness of sound is required
without regard to range and quality
there are some notable conformations,
as in the Whooping Crane and the
Howling Monkey. This Monkey has
large cavities communicating with the
glottis, and the air reverberates as it
passes the larynx so the most deafening
noises are produced.</p>

<p>Birds sing and other animals yell,
roar, and snort, not for love-making
purposes, but rather because of the joy
of life that is in these creatures, and it
manifests itself in this way as well as
in the gambols of the Lambkin or the
antics of the Monkey. The voice of
the Mule is the sweetest sound in the
world&mdash;to some other Mule. But it is
sweeter still to the Mule that makes
the joyful sound. Placzeck notes that
a bird frequently sings lustily when he
knows himself to be entirely alone.
"In the spring-time of love, when all
life is invigorated, and the effort to
win a mate by ardent wooing is crowned
with the joy of triumph, the song
reaches its highest perfection. But the
male bird also sings to entertain his
mate during the arduous nest-building
and hatching, to cheer the young and,
if he be a domesticated bird, to give
pleasure to his lord and the Providence
that takes care of him, and in doing so
to please himself. Lastly, the bird
sings&mdash;by habit, as we call it&mdash;because
the tendency is innate in the organs of
song to exercise themselves." In other
words, animals have the apparatus for
making noises provided them in their
organs of breathing, and because they
have them they use them and are delighted
with them, each in his own
kind. Finding them a source of joy
unto themselves it is not to be wondered
at that they employ their voices
in their love-making because they feel
that what pleases themselves so much
must not be without effect upon their
loved ones.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE common opinion of the Lion
from the remotest times is that
he is King of Beasts, and a single
glance at his face of majesty is
sufficient to make us accept it. His
roar is terrific, and the fact is well
known that all animals tremble at the
mere sound of his voice. The effect of
it on his subjects is said to be indescribable.
"The howling Hyena is stricken
dumb, though not for long; the Leopard
ceases to grunt; the Monkeys utter
a loud, gurgling sound and mount to
the highest tree-tops; the Antelopes
rush through the bushes in a mad flight;
a bleating flock becomes silent; the
laden Camel trembles and listens no
longer to his driver's appeal, but throws
load and rider off and seeks salvation
in flight; the Horse rears, snorts, and
rushes back; the Dog, unused to the
chase, creeps up to his master with a
wail." But it is said we must not think
that the Lion lets his roar re-echo
through the wilderness at all times.
His usual sounds are a deep growl and a
long-drawn tone, like the mewing of a
giant Cat. His real roar is uttered
comparatively seldom, and many people
who have visited countries inhabited
by Lions have never heard it. It
is the only one of its kind, and is surpassed
in fullness of tone by the voice
of no living creature except the male
Hippopotamus, according to Pechnel-Loesche.
"The Arabs have a pertinent
expression for it: '<i>raad</i>,' meaning thunder.
It seems to come from the very
depth of the chest and to strain it to
the utmost."</p>

<p>This Lion is distributed all over Central
and Southern Africa. They are
regularly met with on the banks of the
Blue and White Nile, and in the deserts
of central and Southern Africa they
are of common occurrence.</p>

<p>The Lion leads a solitary life, living
with his mate only during the breeding
season. Selous says that in South Africa
one more frequently meets four or
five Lions together than single specimens,
and troops of ten or twelve are
not extraordinary. His experience
taught him that the South African Lion
prefers feasting off the game some hunter
has killed to exerting himself to
capture his own prey. This is why
he regularly follows nomadic tribes
wherever they go; he regards them as
his tributary subjects and the taxes he
levies on them are indeed of the heaviest
kind.</p>

<p>The Cubs are usually two or three
and the Lioness treats them with great
tenderness. They play together like
Kittens. In well-managed zoological
gardens Lions are now bred as carefully
as Dogs; and even in circuses,
where the animals have but little room
and often insufficient nourishment, they
are born and sometimes grow up. The
cubs are at first rather clumsy. They
are born with their eyes open and are
about half the size of a Cat. Towards
the close of the first year they are about
the size of a strong Dog. In the third
year the mane begins to appear on the
male, but full growth and distinction of
sex, according to Brehm, are only completed
in the sixth or seventh year.
Lions in captivity have lived to be seventy
years old.</p>

<p>Brehm, who loved the Lion and was
probably better acquainted with his
habits than any other traveler, says:
"The most prominent naturalists give
the Lion credit for qualities which in
my opinion include nobility enough.
And whoever has become more closely
acquainted with that animal; whoever
has, like myself, intimately known a
captive Lion for years, must think as I
do; he must love and esteem it as much
as a human being can love and esteem
any animal."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CACTUS" id="THE_CACTUS"></a>THE CACTUS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_b.jpg" width="56" height="70"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">BECAUSE the Greeks in olden
times applied the word Cactus
to a prickly plant, Linnæus,
often called the Father of Botany,
gave the same name to our wonderful
American growth and since his
time these strange and varied plants
have borne this nomenclature.</p>

<p>We can hardly imagine any group of
plants more interesting. There are
over eight hundred varieties of curious
and unexpected forms, bearing tubular
or rotate flowers most varied in size
and color&mdash;white, pink, purple, yellow,
crimson, deep red&mdash;all beautiful and
fascinating, and in our Northern country,
protected in the conservatories.
The Night-blooming Cereus is most
renowned, most admired of all.</p>

<p>The Cacti are commonly found in the
United States, in Mexico, and in South
America, and some species are cultivated
on the borders of the Mediterranean
Sea, where the fruit is eaten.</p>

<p>They vary in size from an inch or two
in height to enormous growths of fifty
or sixty feet (<i>Cereus giganteus</i>) which
stand like telegraph poles, sometimes
nearly bare, sometimes with
many vertical branches, reminding
one of a huge candelabrum. Then
again some forms are nearly spherical,
while others are long, jointed, and
square, one species (<i>Echinocactus visnaga</i>)
grows about nine feet in height
with a diameter of three feet or more
and a single plant of this species will
sometimes weigh a ton. One of our
most common forms is flat and broad.
This, the Prickly Pear or Indian Fig
(<i>Opentia Vulgario</i>), is the only species
found as far north as Wisconsin and
New York.</p>

<p>As many of the Cacti require but little
care, they are quite extensively cultivated,
not only for the rare beauty of
their flowers, but for economic purposes.
However, nearly all are worthy of culture
because of their peculiar forms.</p>

<p>In structure they are fitted for growth
in the most arid regions; they abound
in the deserts of New Mexico and
southward, in many cases obtaining
their food from a soil in which no other
plant will grow, their thick coats enabling
them to retain moisture and vitality
for many weeks. Specimens of
the Prickly Pear have been known to
grow after lying on a dry floor, in a
closed room, for six months and they
have blossomed when left in this condition
for some time.</p>

<p>These plants, which are more or less
succulent, are usually protected from
the ravages of animal life by a formidable
array of spines and prickles. Those
who have carelessly handled our common
Prickly Pear can attest to the intensely
irritating character of its defensive
armor. Thus does nature provide
for the care of its otherwise defenseless
forms.</p>

<p>A form of the Prickly Pear (<i>Opuntia
coccinellifera</i>) is cultivated in Mexico for
the purpose of raising the Cochineal insect
(<i>Coccus cacti</i>) which feeds upon it.
Some of these plantations contain as
many as 50,000 plants. The females are
placed on the Cactus in August and in
about four or five months the first
gathering of the Cochineal takes place,
being then ready for the market.</p>

<p>There are many other interesting
uses to which these plants are put.
When suffering from thirst animals will
tear off the hard outer fibers and
eagerly devour the moist, juicy interior
of the stems. The Moki Indian
basket makers use the fiber in their
work. This they dye different colors
and wind around the foundations, giving
strength and beauty. The spines of
one species (<i>Echinocactus visnaga</i>) are
used by the Mexicans as toothpicks. It
has been estimated that a single plant
may bear upward of 50,000 spines.</p>

<p>A unique and beautiful sight was a
group of Cacti blooming in a Colorado
garden, where the owner had spent
much time and expense in gathering together
many varieties, and one was
made to realize how remarkable a thing
Nature had lavished upon us:  for, as
Mr. Grant Allen has said:  "The Cactuses
are all true American citizens by
birth and training, and none of them
are found truly indigenous in any part
of the Old World."</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE Mistletoe, particularly that
which grows on the Oak, was
held in great veneration by
the Britons. At the beginning of
their year the Druids went in solemn
procession into the forests, and raised
a grass altar at the foot of the finest
Oak, on which they inscribed the
names of those gods which were considered
the most powerful. After this
the chief Druid, clad in a white garment,
ascended the tree and cropped
the Mistletoe with a consecrated
golden pruning-hook, the other Druids
receiving it in a pure, white cloth,
which they held beneath the tree. The
Mistletoe was then dipped in the water
by the principal Druid and distributed
among the people as a preservative
against witchcraft and disease. If any
part touched the ground it was considered
an omen of some dreadful misfortune.</p>

<p>In the Eddas of mythological Norse
lore, Loke, the evil spirit, is said to
have made the arrow with which he
wounded Balder (Apollo), the son of
Friga (Venus), of a branch of Mistletoe.
Balder was charmed against everything
which sprang from fire, earth, air,
and water, but the Mistletoe, springing
from neither of these, was fatal, and
Balder was not restored to the world
till by a general effort of the other
gods. In some parts of Germany and
Switzerland it is believed that by holding
in the hand a branch of Mistletoe
one will be enabled not only to see, but
to converse with departed spirits.</p>

<p>The Druids, partly because the Mistletoe
was supposed to grow only on
the Apple tree and the Oak, and also
on account of the usefulness of the
fruit, paid great attention to its cultivation.
Many old rites and ceremonies,
in connection with the Apple, are practiced
to this day in some parts of England.
On Christmas Eve the farmers
and their men take a huge bowl of
cider, with a smoking piece of toasted
bread in it and, carrying it to the
orchard, salute the Apple trees with
great ceremony, in order to make them
bear well next season.</p>

<p>The wassail bowl drank on Christmas
Eve, and on other church festivals,
was compounded of old ale, sugar, nutmegs,
and roasted apples, of which
each person partook, taking out an
apple with a spoon and then a deep
draught out of the bowl.</p>

<p>Under the Mistletoe of Christmas,
the custom of kissing has been handed
down to us by our Saxon ancestors,
who, on the restoration of Apollo, dedicated
the plant to Venus, the Goddess
of Love and Beauty. It was placed
entirely under her control, thus preventing
its ever again being used
against her in future ages.&mdash;<i>E. K. M.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">WITH the exception of Australia,
Squirrels are found in all parts
of the globe; they extend tolerably
far north and are found
in the hottest parts of the South. As
a family they are lively, quick, and nimble
in their movements, both in trees
and upon the ground, Flying Squirrels
alone being ill at ease when upon the
surface of the earth. In compensation
for this, however, they are possessed of
a faculty which enables them to make
exceedingly long leaps, which they take
in an obliquely descending direction.</p>

<p>The nocturnal Flying Squirrels, says
Brehm, differ from the diurnal Tree
Squirrels mainly in having their fore
and hind legs connected by a wide flying-membrane.
This membrane acts
as a parachute, and enables them to execute
considerable leaps with ease, in
an inclined plane from above downward.
This membrane consists of a
stout skin, extending along both sides
of the body, thickly grown with hair on
the upper side, while the lower one
shows but a scanty covering. A bony
spur at the first joint of the fore-legs
gives especial strength to the membrane.
The tail serves as an effective
rudder and is always vigorous, though
it is not of the same conformation in
the different species, one group having
it simply bushy, while the other has the
hair on it arranged in two lateral rows.
There are also slight differences in the
structure of the teeth.</p>

<p>The Flying Squirrel of North America,
Assapan, is next to the smallest
variety of the whole species, the Jaguan,
or East Indian, being the largest, nearly
equaling a cat in size.</p>

<p>The fur of the North American Flying
Squirrels is exceedingly soft and
delicate. In captivity they suffer themselves,
by day, to be gently handled,
making no effort to bite with their little
sharp teeth as other Squirrels do.
Overcome with sleep they lie curled up
in their cage, as much hidden from
view as possible, rarely bestirring themselves
before nine o'clock at night.
Then, "on the upper edge of the sleeping-box,
which one must give them as
a substitute for their nest, a round little
head becomes visible; the body follows
and soon one of the little creatures sits
on the narrow edge of the box in a
graceful Squirrel-like attitude, the flying
membrane half folded against its
body, half hanging down in a soft
curve. The small, expanded ears move
back and forth as does the bewhiskered
muzzle, and the large, dark eyes inquisitively
scan the cage and surroundings.
If nothing suspicious is visible, the Assapan
glides down like a shadow,
always head first, whether the plane be
inclined or vertical, without any noise,
without a perceptible movement of the
limbs, the greater part of which is covered
with the membrane. It proceeds
on the woven ceiling of the cage, back
downward, as if it walked on level
ground; it rope-dances over thin
twigs with unsurpassed precision and
agility at a uniform speed; spreading
its membrane to the full, it darts
through the whole space of the cage
like an arrow, and the next instant
seems glued to the perch, without having
made an effort to regain its balance.</p>

<p>During all this moving about it picks
up a crumb, a nut, a grain of meat from
its dish; drinks, sipping more than it
laps, washes its head with saliva, combs
its hair with the nails of its fore-feet,
smooths it with the soles of its small
paws, turning, stretching, stooping all
the while, as if its skin were a bag in
which its body sits quite loosely.</p>

<p>After hunger and thirst are somewhat
appeased, and the toilet over, a playful
humor succeeds. Up and down, head
upward or inverted, along the ceiling,
or the floor, running, jumping, gliding,
soaring, hanging, sitting, rushing ahead
as if it could move a thousand joints at
once, as if there were no such thing as
gravity to be overcome."</p>

<h2><a name="HUMMING-BIRDS" id="HUMMING-BIRDS"></a>HUMMING-BIRDS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg" width="24" height="70"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IF these exquisite little creatures are
called Humming-birds, you little
folk may ask, why wasn't the Bee
called a Buzzard because it buzzes?</p>

<p>Well, really, that is a question which
I will not attempt to answer, but the
fact remains that no other name would
have been so appropriate for these
jewel-like birds but the one above, on
account of the humming sound which
they produce when hovering in their
curious fashion over a tempting blossom,
and feeding on its contents while
suspended in air.</p>

<p>There are four hundred and sixty-seven
species of these little birds,
and no two of them, 'tis said, make
precisely the same sound, one producing
a noise exactly like the whizzing
of a wheel driven by machinery,
while that of another is very like
the droning hum of a large Bee. But
no two voices in even one human
family, you know, are alike, so it is
not amazing that the rule holds good
among the birds.</p>

<p>You can capture and tame these
lovely little creatures, too, though I
wouldn't advise you to keep them in a
cage very long. They will pine away
and look very doleful if you do.
Rather, after you have accustomed
them to your presence, and fed them
regularly upon the honey and syrup
and other sweets which they dearly
love, open the cage door and give them
their liberty. A gentleman once did
this and was delighted to see them return
to their old quarters in a very little
while. By watching them the next
morning after setting them free again,
he found they had been pining for a
nice fresh garden Spider which they
had been accustomed to daintily pick
from the center of his web. He had
provided them with Spiders and Flies,
but they wanted to flit about and
search for themselves. For dessert
they liked the sweets which he gave
them, so back they went to their cage,
instead of extracting it from the flowers
with their long bills, as they were wont
to do.</p>

<p>A Humming-bird one summer built
its nest in a butternut tree very near a
lady's window. She could look right
down into its nest, and one day, as it began
to rain, she saw the mother-bird
take one or two large leaves from a
tree near by and cover her little birdlings
with it. She understood how to
make an umbrella, didn't she?</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IT has been said that what a beautiful
sonnet is to the mind, one of these
fairy-like creations is to the eyes.
This is true even in the case of
mounted specimens, which must necessarily
have lost some of their iridescence.
Few can hope to see many of
them alive. The gorgeous little birds
are largely tropical, the northern limit
of their abundance as species being the
Tropic of Cancer. They are partial to
mountainous regions, where there is
diversity of surface and soil sufficient
to meet their needs within a small
area. The highlands of the Andes in
South America are the regions most
favored by a large number of species.
They are most abundant in Ecuador,
the mountain heights affording a home
for more than one hundred species.
Columbia has about one hundred species;
Bolivia and Peru claim about
ninety-six; then follow, in consecutive
order, Central America, Brazil, Venezuela,
Mexico, Guiana, the West Indies,
and the United States.</p>

<p>The eastern part of the United States
has but one representative of the Humming-bird
family, and only seventeen
species have been found within the
limits of the country. As ten of these
really belong to the Mexican group,
we can claim ownership of only seven,
most of which, however, migrate far
south in winter. Only one of these,
the Anna, spends the winter in the
warm valleys of California.</p>

<p>Most of the Hummers are honey-lovers,
and they extract the sweetest
juices of the flowers.</p>

<p>The "soft susurrations" of their
wings, as they poise above the flowers,
inserting their long beaks into tubes of
nectar, announce their presence. Some
of the Warblers and Kinglets will
sometimes poise in this way before a
leaf and peck an insect from its surface,
but it is not a regular habit with
them. The Hummer's ability to move
backwards while on the wing is one of
the most wonderful features of its
flight, and this movement, Mr. Ridgway
says, is greatly assisted by a forward
flirt of the bird's expanded tail.</p>

<p>The nests of the Humming-birds are
of cup-shape and turban-shape, are
composed chiefly of plant-down, interwoven
and bound together with Spider
webs, and decorated with lichens and
mosses. Usually the nest is saddled
upon a horizontal or slanting branch or
twig, but that of the Hermit Hummer
is fastened to the sides of long, pointed
leaves, where they are safe from Monkeys
and other predaceous animals.</p>

<p>"Dwelling in the snowy regions of
the Andes are the little gems called
Hill-stars," says Leander S. Keyser,
"which build a structure as large as a
man's head, at the top of which there
is a small, cup-shaped depression. In
these dainty structures the eggs are
laid, lying like gems in the bottom of
the cups, and here the little ones are
hatched. Some of them look more
like bugs than birds when they first
come from the shell. The method of
feeding the young is mostly by regurgitation;
at least such is the habit
of the Ruby-throat, and no doubt
many others of the family follow the
fashions of the Humming-bird land.
The process is as follows: The parent
bird thrusts her long bill far down into
the throat of her bantling, and then, by
a series of forward plunges that are
really terrible to witness, the honey food
is pumped from the old bird's craw
into that of the youngster. So far as
is known the babies enjoy this vigorous
exercise and suffer no serious consequences
from it."</p>

<h2><a name="CHRISTMAS_TREES" id="CHRISTMAS_TREES"></a>CHRISTMAS TREES.</h2>

<p class="ac">FRED. A. WATT.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_o.jpg" width="57" height="70"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">OUR Christmas tree is a relic of
the old heathen times and came
down to us as a part of the
Yule festival. It seems to have
originated in Germany and can be
traced back as far as the year 1604 with
certainty, and as it was an established
custom at that time it is evidently much
older.</p>

<p>How the early man conceived the
idea is open to dispute, but in my opinion
it is due to an old superstition
which has some believers even to this
day. It is said that any maid who is
not kissed under the Mistletoe at
Christmas will not be married during
the year following. I have no doubt
that the anxiety of the young ladies to
be always found under the Mistletoe
on that day has led to the profuse green
decorations, from which it is only a
step to the Christmas tree.</p>

<p>It was introduced into the Court of
St. James in 1840 by Prince Consort
Albert of Saxe-Cobourg, and the custom
spread rapidly through the aristocratic
families of London and was
almost immediately adopted by all
classes throughout England.</p>

<p>It was introduced into the court at
Paris in 1830 by the Duchess of Orleans
and is now a French custom.</p>

<p>It seems, however, that in our own
country it has taken deepest root.
Here, by reason of the democratic nature
of the people, it may be said to be
distinctively American, as the German
who first introduced it undoubtedly
became an American citizen long ago and
his successors are probably numbered
among our best citizens even to the
present time. Our people of all nationalities
have adopted it and we find
it installed in our churches, our family
gatherings, our schools, and private
clubs. Our nineteenth century inventor
has even tried to change it into an affair
of cast iron, through whose hollow
trunk and branches gas pipes are conducted
and gas jets among the branches
take the place of candles. One of the
results of all this is that the demand
for Christmas trees and Christmas
greens has grown to enormous proportions
in our larger cities and furnishes
employment during the latter part of
September and through November and
December to a number of people who
make a business of gathering the gay
green branches and transporting them
to market.</p>

<p>While traveling through the southern
part of Maine a few years ago, I was
struck by the symmetry and beauty of a
tract of Evergreen Trees and remarked
that they would make good Christmas
trees. I afterward found that such was
likely to be their fate, as men who make
a business of "clam-whopping" and
fishing during the summer months
turned their attention during the fall to
the business of gathering these trees
and shipping them to New York, Philadelphia,
and Boston.</p>

<p>In looking the subject up to determine
what became of all these Trees I
found an industry which I had not
dreamed of. I find that the Christmas
greens for New York City were first
shipped from Keyport, N. J. That as the
demand for them assumed larger proportions
the raw material was exhausted in
that neighborhood, but the inhabitants
having become interested in the business,
and finding it a source of profit,
have continued to advance into the
surrounding country, little by little, until
now they are gathering Spruce from
Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont,
Princess Pine from Vermont, White
Pine from Michigan and even Wisconsin,
Laurel and Holly from the South,
and in fact they can now gather only
Balsam on the home grounds in paying
quantities.</p>

<p>In addition to the above-named evergreens,
quantities of Ground Pine, Cape
Flowers, Fir, Hemlock, the plants of
the Club Mosses, berried Black Alder,
Quill Weed, and Mistletoe are sought
out and gathered wherever found and
shipped&mdash;the Christmas trees to New
York where they lie piled up by thousands
along West street facing the dock
lines, for several weeks before the holidays,
and the other greens to Keyport
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
and vicinity where they are made up
into stars, anchors, crosses, wreaths,
hearts, triangles, horseshoes, and miles
of roping for decorative purposes.</p>

<p>For the entire length of Monmouth
county the families within a mile of the
bay shore are nearly all engaged in the
business of making these decorations
at this season. Four miles from Keyport
is the town of Keansburg which
now surpasses the former place in this
industry. Neighbors are referred to as
"making" or "not making" and numbers
of new faces appear in the town,
attracted by the industry from the
north, south, and west. The wages
paid are not high but anyone who can
"make" can always find a position during
the busy season.</p>

<p>The small villages along this strip of
country now present a pretty appearance.
The houses are almost hidden
behind stacks of evergreens of all kinds.
A peep into a detached summer kitchen
will disclose a group of girls gathered
around a long table piled high with
evergreens, and at first glance they
appear to be principally engaged in
pleasant conversation, but you will not
have to watch them long before you
are aware that their busy fingers are
turning out Christmas decorations at
an astonishing rate. Or, if you should
happen to look in at night, you might
see the tables and evergreens pushed
to one side and gay groups of girls and
young boat-builders, oystermen, and
fishermen engaged in a lively neighborhood
dance.</p>

<p>Materials other than evergreens are
used in this industry to a considerable
extent; laths are used to make frames
for the stars and crosses. Willows
are gathered in quantities from the
marshes with which frames for wreaths
are made, but the trade in rattan is
probably the most benefited, as nothing
else will give such satisfaction in
making the frames for hearts, anchors,
and other decorations of this kind.</p>

<p>The completed decorations are
shipped to New York, Philadelphia, and
Boston, but not to Chicago. In Chicago
we find a different state of affairs.
We are so near the evergreen forests
of Wisconsin, where Christmas trees
may be had for practically nothing,
that the cost of transportation alone
from New Jersey would be greater
than the price realized would amount
to.</p>

<p>Numbers of hulks of condemned
vessels lie in and around Chicago
which are practically worthless. These
boats are taken in the fall by seamen
who are out of employment up along
the Wisconsin coast and there loaded
with evergreens, are brought back to
the Chicago river and docked, and lie
there until the load is disposed of to
the holiday trade. The decorations
are mainly manufactured in the city in
the store-rooms of the dealers.</p>

<p>That the business of bringing these
trees down from the north is not without
serious danger and hardship is
evidenced by the wreck of the schooner
S. Thal, which occurred off the coast
near Glencoe, Ill., a short time ago, in
which five lives were lost. Five lives
yielded up that our children may enjoy
an hour of pleasure!</p>

<p>Do they ever think of the cost?</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SILK-WORM" id="THE_SILK-WORM"></a>THE SILK-WORM.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" width="58" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE Caterpillar, or Silkworm, is at
first of a dark color, but soon becomes
light, and in its tints much
resembles the perfect insect&mdash;a
circumstance common in Caterpillars.
Its proper food is the Mulberry, though
it will likewise eat the Lettuce, and some
few other plants, on which, however, it
does not thrive equally well, and the
silk yielded is of a poor quality.</p>

<p>The Silkworm is about eight weeks
in arriving at maturity, during which
period it changes its skin four or five
times. When about to cast its skin it
ceases to eat, raises the forepart of the
body slightly, and remains in perfect
repose. In this state it necessarily
continues for a time, in order that the
new skin, which is at this time forming,
may become sufficiently mature to enable
the Caterpillar to burst through
the old one. This operation is performed
thus: The forepart of the old
skin is burst; the Silkworm then, by continually
writhing its body, contrives to
thrust the skin back to the tail and disengage
itself; this is difficult, however,
since it is no uncommon occurrence for
them to die from not being able to free
themselves.</p>

<p>When full grown the Silkworm commences
spinning its web in some convenient
spot, and as it does not change
the position of the hinder portions of
its body much, but continues drawing
its thread from various points, and attaching
it to others, it follows that after
a time its body becomes, in a great
measure, enclosed by the thread. The
work is then continued from one thread
to another, the Silkworm moving its
head and spinning in a zig-zag way, bending
the forepart of the body back to
spin in all directions within reach, and
shifting the body only to cover with
silk the part which was beneath it. In
this way it encloses itself in a cocoon
much shorter than its own body. During
the time of spinning the cocoon the
Silkworm decreases in length considerably,
and after the work is done it is not
half its original length. At this time it
becomes quite torpid, soon changes its
skin, and appears in the form of a chrysalis.
In this state the animal remains
about three weeks; it then bursts its case
and comes forth in the imago state, the
moth having previously dissolved a portion
of the cocoon by means of a fluid
which it ejects. The moth is short
lived; the female in many instances dies
almost immediately after she has laid
her eggs; the male survives her but a
short time.</p>

<p>China was the first country in which
the labors of the Silkworm were availed
of, and Aristotle was the first Greek author
who mentions it. It was not until
the fifteenth century that the manufacture
of silk was established in England.
The raising of Silkworms in the United
States has been attempted with success
in the Southern States, and especially in
California. As the Silkworms in Europe
are affected by disease, immense
quantities of eggs are sent from this
country.</p>

<p>Reeling from the cocoons is only performed
in countries where the silk is
produced. In plain silk-weaving the
process is much the same as in weaving
wool or linen, but the weaver is assisted by
a machine for the even distribution of the
warp, which frequently consists of eight
thousand separate threads in a breadth
of twenty inches. The Jacquard loom,
invented by a weaver of Lyons, has been
the means of facilitating and cheapening
the production of fancy or figured
silks to an extraordinary extent.</p>

<p>The Pan-American delegates during
their tour through this country were
presented with silk flags by the Woman's
Silk-Culture Association of Philadelphia.
The flags were made from
material produced in the United States.</p>

<p>The eggs from which our photograph
was taken are "live eggs," and if
properly handled will hatch out in the
spring. In order to bring about this
result care must be taken that they do
not become too warm; freezing will
not hurt them, but heat or dampness
will cause them to hatch or spoil.</p>

<p>Forty thousand eggs weigh about
one ounce, and when hatched will produce
about one hundred pounds of
fresh cocoons.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A GOOD man," said Plutarch,
"will take care of his Horses
and Dogs, not only while they
are young, but when old and
past service."</p>

<p>The organs of sense, and consequently
feeling itself, are the same as
they are in human creatures. I can't
imagine how a man not hardened in
blood and massacre is able to see a
violent death, and the pangs of it,
without concern.&mdash;<i>Bernard de Mandeville,
1723.</i></p>

<p>However we may differ as to speculative
points of religion, justice is a
rule of universal extent and invariable
obligation. See that no brute of any
kind, whether intrusted to thy care or
coming in thy way, suffer through thy
neglect or abuse. Let no views of
profit, no compliance with custom, and
no fear of the ridicule of the world, even
tempt thee to the least act of cruelty
or injustice to any creature whatsoever.
But let this be your invariable rule
everywhere, and at all times, to do
unto others as, in their condition, you
would be done unto.&mdash;<i>Humphry Primatt,
D. D., 1776.</i></p>

<p>But a full-grown Horse or Dog is,
beyond comparison, a more rational,
as well as more conversable animal
than an infant of a day, a week, or even
a month old. But suppose the case
were otherwise, what would it avail?
The question is not, Can they <i>reason</i>?
nor, Can they <i>talk</i>? but, Can they <i>suffer</i>?&mdash;<i>Jeremy
Bentham, 1780.</i></p>

<p>Animals are endued with a capability
of perceiving pleasure and pain;
and from the abundant provision which
we perceive in the world for the gratification
of their several senses, we must
conclude that the Creator wills the
happiness of these his creatures, and
consequently that humanity towards
them is agreeable to him, and cruelty
the contrary. This, I take it, is the
foundation of the rights of animals, as
far as they can be traced independently
of scripture, and is, even by
itself, decisive on the subject, being the
same sort of argument as that on which
moralists found the Rights of Mankind,
as deduced from the Lights of
Nature.&mdash;<i>Thomas Young, 1798.</i></p>

<p>The claims of the lower animals to
humane treatment, or at least to exemption
from abuse, are as good as
any that man can urge upon man.
Although less intelligent, and not immortal,
they are susceptible of pain;
but because they cannot remonstrate,
nor associate with their fellows in defense
of their rights, our best theologians
and philosophers have not condescended
to plead their cause, nor
even to make mention of them; although,
as just asserted, they have as
much right to protection from ill-usage
as the best of their masters have.&mdash;<i>W.
Youatt, 1839.</i></p>

<p>There is a moral as well as a physical
character to all animal life, however
humble it may be&mdash;enveloped indeed
in obscurity, and with a mysterious
solemnity which must ever belong
to the secrets of the Eternal. Let us
then approach with caution the unknown
character of the brute, as being
an emanation from Himself; and treat
with tenderness and respect the helpless
creatures derived from such a
source.&mdash;<i>Ralph Fletcher, 1848.</i></p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">DOCTOR BREWER states that
the single species composing
this very distinct genus belongs
to western North America, and,
so far as known, has the most restricted
distribution of all the large raptorial
birds in the world. It is found on the
coast ranges of southern California from
Monterey Bay southward into Lower
California. It has become very much
reduced in numbers and extinct in localities
where it was formerly abundant,
which is doubtless due to the indiscriminate
use of poison which is placed on
carcasses for the purpose of killing
Wolves, Bears, Lynxes, Cougars, and
other animals which destroy Sheep,
Calves, and other cattle of the stockmen.
Davie says it is more common in
the warm valleys of California, among
the almost inaccessible cliffs of the
rough mountain ranges running parallel
with the Sierra Nevadas for a hundred
miles south of Monterey. It associates
with the Turkey Buzzard, and the
habits of both species are alike, and they
often feed together on the same carcass.</p>

<p>The Vulture's flight is easy, graceful,
and majestic. A writer who watched
one of these gigantic birds thus pictures
it: "High in air an aeronaut had
launched itself&mdash;the California Condor.
Not a wing or feather moved, but resting
on the wind, like a kite, the great
bird, almost if not quite the equal of its
Andean cousin, soared in great circles,
ever lifted by the wind, and rising
higher and higher into the empyrean.
Not a motion of the wing could be seen
with careful scrutiny through the glass,
but every time the bird turned and
faced the wind it seemed to bound upward
as though lifted by some super-human
power, then bearing away
before it, gathering the force or momentum
which shot its air-laden frame
higher and higher until it almost disappeared
from sight&mdash;a living balloon."</p>

<p>The ordinary California Buzzard and
the singular Ravens of Santa Catalina
Island often give marvelous exhibitions
of soaring or rising into the air without
moving their wings, and when it is remembered
that their bodies are reduced
to a minimum of weight, and that even
the bones are filled with air, it is almost
scientifically and literally true that they
are living balloons. And yet the weight
of the Vulture is sometimes twenty-five
pounds, requiring immense wings&mdash;eight
and a half to eleven feet from tip
to tip&mdash;to support it.</p>

<p>Mr. H. R. Taylor, of the late <i>Nidologist</i>,
says there have probably but three
or four eggs of the California Vulture
been taken, of which he has one. The
egg was taken in May, 1889, in the
Santa Lucia Mountains, San Luis
Obispo County, California, at an altitude
of 3,480 feet. It was deposited in
a large cave in the side of a perpendicular
bluff, which the collector entered
by means of a long rope from above.
The bird was on the nest, which was in
a low place in the rock, and which was,
the collector says, lined with feathers
plucked from her own body. This assertion,
however, Mr. Taylor says, may
be an unwarranted conclusion. From
the facts at hand, it appears that the
California Condor lays but a single egg.</p>

<p>The Condor is not an easy bird to
capture, for it has a fierce temper and
a powerful beak. An unusually large
one, however, was recently taken
in Monterey County, California. To
catch the mighty creature William J.
Barry made use of a lasso, such as
ranchmen have with which to round up
obstreperous cattle. The strength of
one man was barely sufficient to imprison
it. It is said that the appetite
of the bird was not affected by its
loss of liberty.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE West Indian Archipelago,
with its four islands and numberless
islets, is called the
gameless country, because in a region
of more than 100,000 square
miles there are no Monkeys, Bears,
Raccoons, Wild Hogs, Jaguars, Pumas,
Panthers, Lynxes, Wild Cats, Foxes,
Wolves, or Jackals. There is not even a
Woodchuck to be dug out of the many
caves. Dogs and Cats, too, are unknown,
and this lack of household pets
seems to have driven the aborigines to
expedients, for in a book called "Ogilvy's
Voyages" there is a story told of a
San Domingo native who kept a tame
Manatee or Sea Cow that made its
headquarters in an artificial pond, and
was so well trained that when called by
its name it would come out of the
water, go to a neighbor's house and
after receiving food return to the pond,
accompanied by boys who seemed to
charm it by singing, and it often carried
two children on its back. Its instinct
was wonderful. It was once
struck by a pike in the hand of a Spaniard
and after that always refused to
come out of the water when there was
a clothed man near.</p>

<p>Manatees are often seen northwest
of Cuba in shoals, sporting about the
reefs like Sea Lions. They are cunning
creatures and can dodge the harpoon
with more success than any other
aquatic animal. The largest land animal
of this strange territory is a huge
Rat, measuring eighteen inches in
length without the tail. With this exception,
it is claimed, Cuba, Jamaica,
San Domingo, and Porto Rico have no
land animals.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR beauty this bird will compare
favorably with any of the family
except the Wood Duck,
whose colors are more various
and brilliant. Whistler is the name by
which it is more commonly known,
from the peculiar noise of wings made
while flying. In spite of its short, heavy
body and small wings, it covers immense
distances, ninety miles an hour
being the speed credited to it by Audubon,
who, however, was not always accurate
in his calculations. It is an abundant
species throughout the fur countries,
where it frequents the rivers and
fresh-water lakes in great numbers. It
breeds as far north as Alaska, where, on
the Yukon, it nests about the middle of
June. Like the Wood Duck, it makes
its nest in hollow trees and decayed
trunks. This consists of grass, leaves,
and moss, lined with down from the
bird's breast. The eggs are from six
to ten in number, and ashy green in
color.</p>

<p>The Golden-eye is a winter visitant to
Illinois. On Long Island it is better
known among the hunters as the
"Whistler," and by others it is also
called the "Great-head," from its beautifully
rich and thickly crested head.
On that island it is said to be a not very
abundant species, arriving there in company
with other migratory Ducks. Mr.
Girand met with it in the fall and spring
on the Delaware and in Chesapeake
bay. Its food consists of small Shell
and other Fish, which it procures by
diving. In the fall the flesh of the
Golden-eye is very palatable. It is very
shy and is decoyed with great difficulty.
In stormy weather it often takes shelter
in the coves with the Scoup Duck,
and there it may be more readily killed.
Naturally the Golden-eye is chiefly seen
in company with the Buffle-head, the
Merganser, and other species that are
expert divers like itself. When wounded,
unless badly hurt, its power of diving
and remaining under water is said to be
so remarkable that it cannot be taken.</p>

<p>The Golden-eyes always have a sentinel
on the watch to announce the approach
of an enemy. They have been
very little studied in their haunts. The
word <i>Clangula</i> indicates in some degree
the tone of their voices. They swim
under water like fish, out of which they
can bound upward and make off with
prodigious speed.</p>

<h2><a name="GOLDEN_ROD" id="GOLDEN_ROD"></a>GOLDEN ROD.</h2>

<p>A lady who has lately been making a
visit in the West was telling the other
day about the forlorn aspect of the
country out that way to her. "Even
the Golden-rod," she said; "you can't
imagine how scraggly and poor it looks,
compared with our magnificent flowers
along the road here. I wonder what
makes the Western Golden-rod so inferior."
The very next day there arrived
at her house a relative whom she had
been visiting when she was in the West.
He sat on the veranda, and looked indulgently&mdash;even
admiringly&mdash;at the
landscape, and praised its elements of
beauty. But as his eye ran along the
roadside near by, he said: "But there is
one thing that we are ahead of you in&mdash;you
have no such splendid Golden-rod
here as we have out West! The Golden-rod
growing along that road, now, is
tame and poor compared with ours."
What a blessed thing it is that the gold
of our own waysides is richer than the
gold of all other waysides!</p>

<h2><a name="THE_AMERICAN_SKUNK" id="THE_AMERICAN_SKUNK"></a>THE AMERICAN SKUNK.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" width="58" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THIS little animal is distinctively
American, the one figured being
found only in North America.
It has a beautiful jet-black fur, varied
with a larger or smaller amount of
white forming a stripe on each side
of its body and head, and more or less
of its tail. In some cases the white
is reduced to a small "star" at the top
of the head, and without doubt some
specimens are entirely black, while
occasionally a white specimen may be
seen.</p>

<p>The fur of the Black Skunk is considered
the best, and brings the highest
price which decreases as the amount of
white increases, the white ones being
almost valueless. A slight unpleasant
odor clings about the manufactured fur,
which detracts much from its commercial
value, although some dealers claim
that this is never noticed when it is sold
as "Alaska sable."</p>

<p>Another common name for the Skunk
is Polecat. Though found in the woods,
they prefer to inhabit grassy or bushy
plains. During the day they lie sleeping
in hollow trees or stumps, in clefts of
rocks, or in caverns, which they dig for
themselves; at night they rouse themselves
and eagerly seek for prey.
Worms, insects, birds, and small animals,
roots and berries constitute their
food.</p>

<p>The range of the Skunk is quite extensive,
the animal being most plentiful
near Hudson Bay, whence it is distributed
southward.</p>

<p>It is slow in its movements, can
neither jump nor climb, but only walk
or hop. Knowing how formidable is
its weapon of protection, it is neither
shy nor cowardly.</p>

<p>The Skunk is a much respected animal,
both man and beast preferring to
go around him rather than over him,
and many amusing anecdotes are related
by hunters and naturalists, which lead
us to believe that he does not always
come out second best in an encounter.
When in search of food he is so bold
that he can be approached without difficulty,
and he wears a look of innocence
that effectually deceives the
uninitiated, and brings about very unexpected
results.</p>

<p>Hensel says that when it is pursued
by dogs it lays its tail along its back like
a sitting Squirrel, turns its hinder quarters
towards the dogs and performs
queer, angry, hopping antics, such as
one sometimes sees in the cages of
Bears. The attacked animal never
wastes its secretion by unnecessary
haste, but continues to threaten as long
as the dogs are a few yards distant
from it.</p>

<p>"Skunk Farming" cannot be said to
be a growing industry, but there are a
number of such "farms" in the northern
and eastern states which are said
to pay fairly well. A small plat of
land is enclosed by a high board fence;
stakes are driven into the ground close
together under the fence so that the
animals cannot burrow out. Small
shelters are built in, some hay thrown
in for nests, and the farm is ready for
the skunks.</p>

<p>Skunks get very tame in captivity
and tolerably well accustomed to
their keeper, though great care is required
not to irritate them. Hay is
their favorite bed, on which they curl
up like a ball. After eating, they wipe
their snouts with their forepaws, being
very cleanly, and they always keep
their fur dainty and dressed. The fur
is not very fine or soft, but it is valuable
and in considerable demand.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE universe is so ordered that
Birds are essential to the life of
Man. To-day we believe this
and value them accordingly.
Years ago as well as now the birds held
the same relation toward man but the
latter did not then understand this relationship
as we do in this age of scientific
enlightenment. About twenty-eight
hundred years ago, nine hundred
years before the beginning of our era, a
poet flourished in the East, or certain
poets as some scholars maintain. He
is supposed to have been a blind bard,
who wandered around to the courts of
the petty kings, sang his heroic lays and
left them for our inheritance, and a noble
inheritance it is to those who have
the desire and will to go to the depth
of the treasure. These poems tell of
the people of that time and show us
many sides of their life and the chief
characteristics of their civilization.</p>

<p>One scarcely expects from a great
poem, dealing with war and adventure,
to gather information about birds. Yet
it is there, but not so much scientific as
ethical. Birds, they believed, were here
on earth as the messengers of the gods.
Rarely did a bird appear before them or
raise a cry which did not do so by the
direct command of some ruling divinity.
Imagine with what anxiety these old
Greek heroes watched for and listened
to the heaven-sent messages. Great
was the fear at certain omens, and great
the rejoicing at others. As a rule only
special men could interpret these signs
and these men were of immense importance
in a community. They were
almost a priesthood in nature, as nearly
so as any order which the people then
possessed, for the priesthood was not
developed at that time.</p>

<p>In the Iliad, at four of the critical
points in the story a bird appears and
shows the will of the gods to mortals.
It is related that before the Greeks
sailed to Troy, while the ships were yet
assembled at Aulis, one of these omens
occurred and was interpreted thus:
Near the ships was an altar and by the
altar stood a plane-tree, upon the bough
of which a little bird had built its nest,
and already within the nest were nine
fledglings. Suddenly a serpent darted
forth from beneath the altar straight
toward the tree; the nine little birds
were soon devoured and at last the serpent
ended his feast by catching the
mother which had flown crying about
it. At once the serpent was turned into
stone. This wonderful prodigy was
shown by one of the prophets to mean
that for nine years the Greeks would
toil fruitlessly before Troy as the serpent
had devoured the nine little birds;
but in the tenth year they would seize
the city.</p>

<p>The flight of birds was watched and
upon this rested often the movements
of whole armies. As the seer had foretold
for nine years the Greeks had been
fighting before the walls of Troy; their
ships were drawn up on the shore of
the sea and before them they had built
a wall and dug a ditch for protection.
The nine years had passed, the tenth
year was already going by and never
had the people from the beleaguered
city dared to approach their ships.
But now, after so many years, all was
changed. The great hero of the Greeks,
the great swift-footed Achilles, was angry
and refused to fight for them and
sat apart at the stern of his ship on the
shore of the barren sea wearing out his
heart with anger. Now the Trojans,
never before so successful, had reached
the wall and were encamped there for
the night. The Greeks felt that it was
necessary to send out spies to observe
the movements of their foes. Diomede
volunteered his services and chose
Odysseus for his comrade. They crept
away from their companions in the
darkness but had gone only a few steps
when the cry of a Heron was heard on
their right. This meant good luck for
them, for they knew that Athene, the
protecting goddess of Odysseus, had
sent this favoring sign, and it proved
true, for their sally was prospered and
they returned unharmed, having slain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
thirteen of the enemy, and bringing as
booty a noble pair of steeds, a prize in
which all Greeks took delight.</p>

<p>Even in Homer we see the dawning
of skepticism, a skepticism of which we
approve and the sentiment of which we
cannot but admire. The next day after the
favorable sign of Athene to her favorite,
after nine long years of terrible war
the Trojans stand at the very edge of
the ditch before the Greek ships. Hector
their noble leader, a hero who may
well inspire modern men to noble deeds
of patriotism, stands at their head.
One rush more, one impetuous dash
through the ditch and against the wall,
and the ten years' war may be ended
with the weary Trojans victors. But at
this critical moment a bird appears, it
is the favorite bird in Homer and also
the favorite bird with us, for it is our
national bird, the Eagle. Homer calls
it the bird that is surest to bring fulfillment
with its omens and tells us that it
belonged to mighty Zeus the thunderer,
the ruler of gods and men. The bird
appeared flying at the left. The people
halted. A bird flying at the left meant
disapproval. It held in its mouth a
snake not yet dead, which, coiling its
head, bit at the breast of the bird. The
bite was effective, and with a sharp cry,
the bird dropped the serpent at the feet
of the awe-inspired Trojans and fled
shrieking away. Well might the people
halt. What was to be done, an onward
move against such a portent, or a
calm withdrawal when everything was
in their favor? One of the common
people declared that they must withdraw
or death would come upon them.
Then noble Hector with frowning brows
answered him: "Polydamas, no longer
do you speak words pleasing to me.
You know how to speak another word
better than this. If you speak this
truly in earnest, the gods themselves
have taken away your senses from you
who bid me to forget the counsels of
high-thundering Zeus, the promises he
made me and the plans to which he
nodded assent. You bid me put my
trust in long-winged birds which I do
not heed or regard at all, whether they
fly to the right toward the sun and the
dawn, or to the left toward the murky
darkness. Let us trust the counselings
of great Zeus who holds sway over
gods and men. One bird is the best
to defend one's fatherland."</p>

<p>In the last book of the Iliad in the
sad scenes surrounding the death and
burial of this hero we have again an
omen. Priam, the aged, feeble man,
determined to go to the strange, wrathful
Achilles and beg for the body of
his dear son Hector, which the swift-footed
hero had been mutilating in his
wrath, dragging it behind his chariot
about the city walls. Priam was determined
to go. His wife tried to dissuade
him from such a dangerous
undertaking, he bade her not to be a
bird of ill omen in his halls, but she insisted,
and finally persuaded him to
pray to Zeus to send him an omen that
his journey would be successful. He
prayed; thereupon an Eagle appeared
flying at his right. Hecuba was now
satisfied and the old lord of windy
Troy started out on his errand of love.
The omen was true this time for he did
persuade the heart of Achilles and returned
to his city with the remains of
his son.</p>

<p>There are other instances of omens
given by the presence and flight of
birds, but these are sufficient to show
us the great importance which the men
of two thousand years ago attributed to
them. Although birds are most prominent
in Homer in this connection, still we
find them mentioned many times just
as parts of the physical world and without
divine import. Among the birds
thus mentioned we find names which
our scholars have interpreted to designate
Cranes, Meadow Larks, Jackdaws,
Geese, Swans, Nighthawks, Vultures, and
Eagles. Birds are especially noted for
their quickness in flight, and the horses
were most prized which flew like the
birds. Birds were always mentioned
in connection with the dead, and a
favorite curse was to wish that one
might be left a prey to the dogs and
birds.</p>

<p>Gods often honored this part of the
animal world by assuming their forms.
We find Athene and Apollo in the
likeness of Vultures settling down upon
the Oak tree to watch the battle of the
Greeks and Trojans. Sleep watches
the wiles of Juno toward her lord while
he sits as a Nighthawk upon a tree.
But Homer is essentially a poet, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
many places a nature-poet, and in these
touches of nature he does not forget
the birds, but very often compares the
movements of his heroes to them.</p>

<p>"As a tawny Eagle darts upon the
flocks of winged birds feeding by the
river, flocks of Geese, of Cranes, of
long-necked Swans, so Hector darted
upon them."</p>

<p>"The Trojans went with hue and cry&mdash;like
the birds when the cry of
the Cranes is in the front of heaven,
who, when they flee from the winter
and portentous storms, with cries fly
to the streams of Oceanus bearing
death and fate to the Pygmies, and at
dawn they bear forth with them their
evil strife."</p>

<p>"As a bird bears a morsel for its unfledged
young whenever it obtains any,
but fares badly itself, so I have toiled
for other men and gained naught myself."</p>

<p>"As many flocks of birds, of Geese,
Cranes, long-necked Swans, in an Asian
meadow by the banks of the Cayster
fly hither and thither exulting in their
wings as they settle down with cries
and the meadow reëchoes, so flocks of
men poured from the tents and ships
into the plain of the Scamander."</p>

<p>"As a flock of Meadow Larks or
Jackdaws comes with full, unbroken
cry when they see before them a Hawk
which bears destruction to small birds,
so with full, unbroken cry went the
youths of the Achæans before Æneas
and Hector."</p>
